No Java Neither
===============

Because it is commercially owned.

pym's License
=============

pym's `primary license <https://github.com/jalanb/pym/blob/master/LICENSE>`_ is derived from the **JSLint License** (MIT plus the `"The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSLint#License>`_ clause)  without exceptional `permission <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford#.22Good.2C_not_Evil.22>`_
    

This is intended to `deter <http://dev.hasenj.org/post/3272592502/ibm-and-its-minions>`_ use in propietery or commercial contexts. Some parts of pym may also be licensed under versions of the **GPL**, which has the *same intent*. Seriously, ask your boss, your company `does not want <http://www.cnet.com/news/dont-be-evil-google-spurns-no-evil-software/?_escaped_fragment_=#!>`_ you to use pym on their machines, or with their languages.

And that's not what I want either - I want pym to be as free as possible to extend or use, EXCEPT commercially or propietarily (yet).

Non-Commercial use
==================

pym may be used freely with un-owned language. such as

- English
- Python
- Bash

Commercial use
==============

pym may not be used with any owned languages.

You agree that these are, or seem to be, commercially owned languages:

- Java
- VB (a.k.a. Visual Basic)
- Delphi
- Any use of a function or other in a recognisably commercial libray
- ...

pym may not be used on commercially owned machines, except when licensed commercially for that machine.
    
Contributions
=============

No pull requests should be offered related to commercially-owned languages, and you agree that `I <https://github.com/jalanb>`_ decide whether a language is "commercial" (see above)

Pull requests will be accepted subject to pusher's licensing
    Acceptable licenses:

       - `WTFPL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL#Reception>`_
       - `MIT <https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license>`_
       - `FreeBSD <https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-2-clause-license-(freebsd)>` and "`3 BSD <https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-3-clause-license-(revised)>`_"
       - JSLint `Not Evil <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSLint#License>`_ LICENSE, with different exceptional `permission <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford#.22Good.2C_not_Evil.22>`_s than pym

    These are not accepted, unless pusher agrees to re-licensing under pym's license

        - GPL, or any other `copyleft <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft>`_ licenses

Consequences
============

pym and derivatives are `not Free (nor Open Source) <http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-legal%40lists.debian.org/msg40718.html>`_ Software.

But no worries, I expect you'll do good when you're not working.
