No Java Neither
===============

Because it is commercially owned.

Pym's License
=============

Pym's `primary license <https://github.com/jalanb/pym/blob/master/LICENSE>`_ is derived from the **JSLint License** (MIT plus the `"The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSLint#License>`_ clause)  with no `exceptions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford#.22Good.2C_not_Evil.22>`_.
    

This is intended to `deter <http://dev.hasenj.org/post/3272592502/ibm-and-its-minions>`_ use in propietery or commercial contexts. Some parts of Pym may also be licensed under versions of the **GPL**, which has the *same intent*. Seriously, ask your boss, your company `does not want <http://www.cnet.com/news/dont-be-evil-google-spurns-no-evil-software/?_escaped_fragment_=#!>`_ you to use pym on their machines, or with their languages.

And that's not what I want either - I want pym to be as free as possible to extend or use, EXCEPT commercially or propietarily (yet).

Commercial use
==============

Pym may not be used with an owned language (yet).

You agree that these look like commercially owned languages

- Java
- VB (a.k.a. Visual Basic)
- VB for ...
- Delphi
- Didn't Borland do another one for their database?
- The one under FogBugz (probably)
- Tcl/TK (maybe ?)
- Any use of a function or other in a recognisably commercial libray
- ...

Pym may not be used on commercially owned machines, except when the user or owner has agreed commercial terms for such use.
    
Contributions
=============

No pull requests should be offered related to commercially-owned languages, and you agree that `I <https://github.com/jalanb/pym/commit/18399d72da63b3838847487a3c4ded8238f15541>`_ decide whether a language is "commercial" (see above)

Pull requests will be accepted subject to pusher's licensing
    Acceptable licenses:

       - `WTFPL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL#Reception>`_
    These licenses are also acceptable, provided pusher agrees that pym may be released entirely under its own license:
        
        - MIT
        - BSD
        - JSLint `Not Evil <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSLint#License>`_ LICENSE, with different `exceptions <http://dev.hasenj.org/post/3272592502/ibm-and-its-minions>`_ than pym.

    These are not accepted, unless pusher agrees to re-licensing under Pym's license

        - GPL
        - Apache (open to arguments on this)
        - Any other (also this)
        - Any commercial (not this (yet))


Consequences
============

Pym and derivatives are not Free (nor Open Source) Software.

But no worries, I expect you'll do good when you're not working.
