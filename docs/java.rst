No Java Neither
===============

Because it is commercially owned.

Commercial use
==============

Pym may not be used with a commercially language (yet).

Pym may not be used on a commercially owned machine except when the same owner (or user) has agreed commercial terms for such use.
    
You agree that these look like commercially owned languages

- Java
- VB (a.k.a. Visual Basic)
- VB for ...
- Delphi
- Didn't Borland do another one for their database?
- The one under FogBugz
- Tcl/TK (maybe ?)
- Any (call to a function) or other in a recorginsably commercial libray
- ...

Other use
=========

No pull requests should be accepted for commercially-owned languages, and you agree that I decide whether a language is "commercial" (I have decided, so far, that *the above* are all "commercial")

Pull requests will be accepted subject to pusher's licensing
    Acceptable licenses:

       - MIT Not Evil
       - DWTFYWT
    These licenses are also acceptable, provided pusher agrees that pym may be released entirely under its own license:
        
        - MIT
        - BSD
    These are not accepted

        - GPL
        - Apache (open to arguments on this)
        - Any other (also this)
        - Any commercial (not this (yet))
