Links to sourcecodegen
----------------------

  * The source codegen project is stored `on github <https://github.com/malthe/sourcecodegen>`_
  * It is available `in the Cheeseshop <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sourcecodegen/0.6.14>`_


Summary
-------

sourcecodegen is designed to worker with older versions of Python, specifically "2.4 and below", and is not compatible with the new `ast` module in Python 2.6.

It is released under the BSD license, so can be copied for investigation.
