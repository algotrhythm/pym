What is pym?
-----------
pym is an editor for structured text, in particular for Python source code. pym was inspired by vim but it handles structured (not plain) text.

At present pym is entirely vapourware, and consists of some ideas based around manipulation of Abstract Syntax Trees, such as those handled by the `ast module <http://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html?highlight=ast>`_ .

Pretty printing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to be useful to people such trees need to be pretty printed. Some other code which may be helpful in rendering such trees as Python text are
 
 * Python's own unparser

  * The unparser is a script in the `Tools/parser <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3f7d5c235d82/Tools/parser>`_ directory called `unparse.py <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3f7d5c235d82/Tools/parser/unparse.py>`_.
  * This script is a continuation from the `unparse.py file <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/e36513032265/Demo/parser/unparse.py>`_ in the older (`2.7 <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/>`_) `Demo/parser <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/e36513032265/Demo/parser>`_ directory, and has been `intermittently maintained for a few years <http://hg.python.org/cpython/log/d989c3fc9e28/Demo/parser/unparse.py>`_
  * There is `a test script <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3f7d5c235d82/Tools/parser/test_unparse.py>`_ in the same directory, and an equivalent `test script <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/e36513032265/Demo/parser/test_unparse.py>`_ for the 2.7 branch
  * There are some issues about it, such as `this one <http://bugs.python.org/issue14695>`_ claiming that it is out of date.

 * Other unparsers

  * `sourcecodegen <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sourcecodegen/0.6.14>`_
  * `pyRegurgitator <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyRegurgitator>`_
  * `Python-Decompiler <https://github.com/jalanb/Python-Decompiler>`_

A significant initial task shall be to evaluate these unparsers, find their commonalities, find their idiosyncracies, and decide on my own unparsing strategy.

Parsing
^^^^^^^

Parsing in general is of interest. One reason for delay in starting this project has been the postponing of the choice between using Python's built-in parsing modules, or more general parsing components. Although I have now decide to start with Python's built in parser I remain committed to use of other parser. Not much point in having a "structured text editor" which cannot handle structured text such as other langages, marked-up texts, config files, log files, and so on.

Other parsers, written in Python but parsing other structures.

Parsing produces Abstract Syntax Trees, which have a reasonable amount of related documentation. Green Tree Snakes was a proximate spur to this project, and the other links in this section were found thence.

Related tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Autopep8 is a tool which re-writes Python source code (to increase compliance with PEP8), but does not use ASTs to do so.
