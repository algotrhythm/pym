Cenk Alti's pyhtml
============================

pyhtml is a project by `Cenk Alti <http://http://cenkalti.net//>`_ which can render html from python sequences. Such sequences can look very similar to the generated html. Which is far more easily seen in `his example <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyHTML#example>`_, than in my explanation.
