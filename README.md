No Java neither.

Documentation
=============

pym remains entirely vapourware at present, but the ideas behind it are being curated over at [ReadTheDocs](https://pym.readthedocs.org). There is some code in the src directory, but still for concept-exploration.

One such concept is that the coder wants to edit structural entitites (e.g. modules, methods, mocks), not incidentals (e.g. text, files).

Another is that the coder doesn't want to write anything at all, s/he should only need to choose their favourite cliches, algorithms, functions, packages, ...
