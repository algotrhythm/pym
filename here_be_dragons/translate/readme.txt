This code translates Java -> C++

Very hacky, many particulars of the code being translated embedded, but based around use of PyMeta. Java grammar is in cpp.g, and used in translate.py

I did wonder if the code could be re-used for different translations, but I reckon too much effort to generalise. "One to throw away"
