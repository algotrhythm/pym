The JSON License

Quick Summary

This is a copy of the MIT License with one important addition: "THE SOFTWARE SHALL BE USED FOR GOOD, NOT evil."

This has caused companies issues when using JSON, Douglas Crockford, the author of the JSON specification refuses to change this part of the license.
The Free Software Foundation consider this license as non-free for that addition, but IBM got an exemption.
